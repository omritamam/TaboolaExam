R&D Engineer Test
Instructions
The purpose of this test is to evaluate your technical abilities in various aspects of Software
Engineering, Optimizations, Concurrency Issues and Architecture. The test should simulate a
real task in a real working environment.
You can use any resource at your disposal (use the open web). You will be asked to explain
your solution, emphasizing on correctness, design and coding decisions.
We are looking for code that is:
● Working
● Readable
● Tested (please submit unit testing)
● Well designed (Object Oriented)
● Simple code
The code should be in any language you feel comfortable with (Java is preferred, but definitely
not required) and include unit testing.

Questions
The attached file “apache.log” - this is a real apache log file..
The goal is to process this file and output some analytics about the users of the web server.
Specifically, please print the following properties:
1. The list of countries of the site’s visitors, along with the % of users from each country.
2. The operating system distribution.
3. The browser distribution.
Requirements:
● The code must be well designed and extensible, for example: if we want to
extract another property from the log, it should be added easily.
● Precision should be 2 digits after the decimal point.
● The printed list should be sorted in a descending order.
Tips:
● You can (and should) use google and 3rd party libraries.
● Address this exercise like a real task in you day to day job
● Code standards:
○ Object oriented - Hint: Think what would you have to add/change in
order to add an additional metric, or a different usage for the metrics
(beside the distributions). Ensure these changes can be done easily
while keeping your design.
